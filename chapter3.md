## Introduction

In this section we will cover hypothesis testing. We will use `scipy` package for this purpose.

We will cover two types of tests:

- proportion tests (z-test)
- mean tests (t-tests)
Python is flexible enough to allow its user specify various characteristics for tests (e.g. null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, confidence level).

Before going into details letâ€™s load the data.

Recall how we calculated the sum of a column. In order to calculate the mean and standard error we use the similar notation:
```
df.colname.mean()

df.colname.std()

```

`@instructions`


`@hint`
- For indexing a column, use the dot notation: `df.column_name`

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Loading pandas
import pandas as pd

# Loading the dataset from seaborn library. We can use URL to load the data from the Web
df = pd.read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/seankross/a412dfbd88b3db70b74b/raw/5f23f993cd87c283ce766e7ac6b329ee7cc2e1d1/mtcars.csv")

# Take a glimpse at the dataset to understand how it looks like
df.head()

# [DIY] Calculate the mean of the "disp" column using dot notation


# [DIY] Calculate the standard deviation of the "disp" column using dot notation


# One can also calculate the means of all numeric columns in a dataset
df.mean()

# [DIY] Calculate the standard deviation of all numeric variables


```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Loading pandas
import pandas as pd

# Loading the dataset from seaborn library. We can use URL to load the data from the Web
df = pd.read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/seankross/a412dfbd88b3db70b74b/raw/5f23f993cd87c283ce766e7ac6b329ee7cc2e1d1/mtcars.csv")

# Take a glimpse at the dataset to understand how it looks like
df.head()

# [DIY] Calculate the mean of the "disp" column using dot notation
df.disp.mean()

# [DIY] Calculate the standard deviation of the "disp" column using dot notation
df.disp.std()

# One can also calculate the means of all numeric columns in a dataset
df.mean()

# [DIY] Calculate the standard deviation of all numeric variables
df.std()

```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_function("df.disp.mean").has_equal_value()
Ex().check_function("df.disp.std").has_equal_value()
Ex().check_function("df.std").has_equal_value()
```
